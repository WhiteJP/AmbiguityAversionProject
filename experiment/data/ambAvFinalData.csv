I was thinking my odds might be 60 or 70 percent since no number was stated in that option. I felt like there was a higher chance my car did not get hit or at least I was trying to positively will it to be that way."
"46","lxen35yz47t","G1B","G","1","B","G1",7,2,"male",57,"correct","It simplifies everything. With the available information, there's no real way to make an intelligent decision on which stock to sell. A 50% chance for each one is simple, so I prefer that one."
