<h4>Introduction</h4>
This project focuses on understanding the decisions people make in situations of risk and uncertainty. We’re interested in understanding the kinds of reasoning people actually go through so you should try to give natural and intuitive responses without overthinking.

<h4>What will I be asked to do?</h4>
In the first part of the study you'll be randomly assigned to an experimental condition corresponding to a simple vignette (a short description of a scenario). In all conditions, we’ll ask you to choose between two options based on the vignette. 

<h4>What are the risks?</h4>
Risks are minimal. The survey does take around two minutes and thus represents a time investment. We hope the experiment may be thought-provoking and interesting, but there is some chance you will find it boring.

<h4>What are the benefits?</h4>
Relatively little is still known about how people reason in situations like those we’re looking at, even though situations like them arise often in the real world. Our long-term goal is to identify what people do and why, and see if we can improve how people make this kind of decision. You will be paid for your contribution; payment will consist of $0.XX for completing the experiment.

<h4>How would my confidentiality be protected?</h4>
As an Amazon Worker, we will not be tracking any identifying information like IP address. Our sample size will be large, making it even more difficult to identify any one person.

<h4>What if I want to withdraw from the Research?</h4>
Participation in this research is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time without penalty (other than not getting paid). Your data will not be used in the full sample unless you complete the experiment.

<h4>Where can I get further information?</h4>
