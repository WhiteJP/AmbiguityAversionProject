You are currently unemployed, but have just been offered a job from two companies: company X and company Y. Both companies compete within an extremely small market so you know that only one of them can be successful and be able to provide you with an ongoing high salary for many years into the future. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you prefer to be in? <br>
A. Either company X or company Y will be successful (but not both), but you do not know the exact probabilities. <br>
B. There is a 50% that company X will be successful and a 50% chance that company Y will be successful. <br><br>
