As mentioned, this experiment involves making choices between different options. However, unlike many studies which ask you to make a choice about <i>what you would do</i> in a certain situation, this experiment asks you to make a choice about which hypothetical situation <b><i>you would rather be in</i></b>.<br><br>

Here's how it will work in a little more depth. You will be presented with a short, life-like scenario which we call a 'vignette'. After reading this vignette, you will be shown two different hypothetical situations that are related to it. You need to tell us which of these two situations <b><i>you would rather be in</i></b>. To do so, you will answer along a scale from "I would definitely rather be in situation A" to "I would definitely rather be in situation B" with "I am indifferent about which situation I would rather be in" in the middle.  <br><br>

Lastly, as we promised, no matter your answers to the following questions, you'll be guaranteed to receive the $0.XX that you signed up for.<br><br>
