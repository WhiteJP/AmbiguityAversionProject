As mentioned, this experiment involves making choices between different options. However, unlike many studies which ask you to make a choice about <i>what you would do</i> in a certain situation, this experiment asks you to make a choice about which hypothetical situations <i>you would prefer to be in</i>.<br><br>

Here's how it will work in a little more depth. You will be presented with a short, life-like scenario which we call a 'vignette'. After reading this vignette, you will see two different hypothetical situations that are related to this vignette. You need to tell us which of these two situations <i>you would prefer to be in</i>. To do so, you will be provided with a scale from 1 to 7: 1 means that you would definitely prefer to be in situation A, 4 means that you have no preference, and 7 means that you would definitely prefer situation B. But don't worry, these descriptions will be shown to you as you make your responses. It's as simple as that! <br><br>

Lastly, as we promised, no matter your answers to the following questions, you'll be guaranteed to receive the $0.XX that you signed up for.<br><br>
