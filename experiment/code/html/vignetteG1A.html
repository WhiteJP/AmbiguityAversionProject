You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: stock X and stock Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received an anonymous tip that one of your stocks is about to skyrocket in value. However, you must sell one of the stocks to pay for emergency medical bills. <br><br>

<label for="choiceType"> Which of the following situations do you hope is true? </label><br>
<input type="radio" name="choiceType" value="aversion" /> There is a 50% chance that stock X will skyrocket and a 50% chance that stock Y will skyrocket. <br>
<input type="radio" name="choiceType" value="noaversion" /> Either stock X or Y will skyrocket in value (but not both), but you do not know the exact probabilities.  <br><br>
