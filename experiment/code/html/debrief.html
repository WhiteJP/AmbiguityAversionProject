The study was pretty straightforward so there’s not much more to say, but in case you’re interested in
more of the background, here it is:<BR><BR>

As we mentioned at the beginning of this experiment, we are researching how people make decisions under risk
and uncertainty. Specifically, we are interested in what has been labelled 'ambiguity aversion': the tendency 
for humans to prefer options in which probabilites are clearly defined (i.e. 'risk') than options which are 
not clearly defined by probability (i.e. 'uncertainty'). This phenomenon has been widely studied, but has
always been done so in relation to contrived games and bets concocoted by experimenters that are rarely analagous
to decisions in the 'real world'. In this study, we are seeking to ascertain whether this ambiguity aversion 
can be seen in more realistic scenarios. <BR><BR>
  
As always, we are very grateful to the thoughtful data you provide, as it tells us a great deal about how
humans think and reason.<BR><BR>
