  The study was pretty straightforward so there’s not much more to say, but in case you’re interested in
more of the background, here it is:<BR><BR>

As we mentioned at the beginning of this experiment, we are researching how people make decisions
where outcomes have different probabilities. Specifically, we are interested in what people do when
faced with so-called “black swan” decisions where one choice has a very low probability of a very
bad outcome. Some of you saw situations where one choice was a black swan, and some saw two; we
want to know if that makes a difference. We also varied whether you had to just make one gamble, or
whether you could set your own policy (i.e., choose A for a certain amount of time, and then choose
B). Do people behave differently, making different bets for the same amount of savings?<BR><BR>
  
Some of you may have had bad luck and lost all of your money at some point. We did want to simulate it truthfully, so we could not prevent this from happening. You still get your minimum payment for your time as well as any extra points/money you
managed to accrue after that event.<BR><BR>
  
As always we are very grateful to the thoughtful data you provide, as it tells us a great deal about how
humans think and reason.<BR><BR>
