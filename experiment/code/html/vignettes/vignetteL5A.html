<form id="vignetteL2A">

On a routine doctor visit, you learn that your body has acquired a pathogen with two possible variants: variant X and variant Y. Your doctor cannot determine which it is without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because each one kills the other. Variant X is potentially deadly while variant Y is somewhat benign. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you rather be in? <br>
A. There is a 50% chance that the pathogen is variant X and a 50% chance that the pathogen is variant Y.<br>
B. The pathogen is either variant X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>
