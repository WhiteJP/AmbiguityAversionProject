You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: stock X and stock Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received an anonymous tip that one of your stocks is about to plummet in value, while the other will continue to grow steadily. Due to taxation and investment regulations, you can only sell one of these stocks. <br><br>

<label for="choiceType"> Which of the following situations do you hope is true? </label><br>
<input type="radio" name="choiceType" value="aversion" /> There is a 50% chance that stock X will plummet and a 50% chance that stock Y will plummet. <br>
<input type="radio" name="choiceType" value="noaversion" /> Either stock X or Y will plummet in value (but not both), but you do not know the exact probabilities. <br><br>
