<form id="vignetteG2B">

You are a medical student and final exams are two weeks away. You have recently been told about two study drugs, drug X and drug Y, which if taken during study can significantly improve memory retention. Both drugs have been shown to work very well, but each works for different people. Unfortunately it so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. Further, both drugs are slow acting, so you only have time to try one before your exams commence. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you prefer to be in? <br>
A. Either drug X or drug Y will improve your memory retention, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br>
B. There is a 50% chance that drug X will improve your memory retention, and a 50% chance that drug Y will improve your memory retention. <br><br>
