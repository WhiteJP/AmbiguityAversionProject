<form id="vignetteL2A">

Your child has extreme talent and interest in two things: X and Y. You have heard that the local schools are planning on discontinuing programs in either X or Y in a few years due to lack of funds; however, at this point they have not decided which one to eliminate. You don't have the funds to get your child private lessons, so their only option is through the schools. Neither your nor your child wants to start something that they will have to stop. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you rather be in? <br>
A. There is a 50% chance that programs in X will be discontinued, and a 50% chance that programs in Y will will be discontinued. <br>
B. Programs in either X or Y will be discontinued, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>
