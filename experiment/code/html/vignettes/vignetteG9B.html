<form id="vignetteG2B">

Your child has extreme talent and interest in two things: X and Y. You have heard that in a few years a local rich person is planning on funding a very generous scholarship for talented young people in either X or Y. However, at this point they have not decided whether to support X or Y. In order for your child to be eligible they will need to receive specialised training starting now, and the skills are sufficiently time-consuming that they need to pick just one. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you rather be in? <br>
A. Either X or Y will get the generous scholarship, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br>
B. There is a 50% chance that X will get the generous scholarship, and a 50% chance that Y will get the generous scholarship. <br><br>
