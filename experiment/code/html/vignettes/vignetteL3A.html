<form id="vignetteL2A">

You have developed an insect infestation in your house. The inspector tells you it is either species X or species Y. He cannot tell which one without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because they are very territorial and will fight each other off. An infestation of species X will ruin the structural integrity of the house and cause it to plummet in value. Species Y, however, is completely benign and will impose no costs (financial, aesthetic, or otherwise) to your property.<br><br>

Which of the following situations would you rather be in? <br>
A. There is a 50% chance that the infestation is of species X and a 50% chance that the infestation is of species Y. <br>
B. The infestation is of either species X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>
