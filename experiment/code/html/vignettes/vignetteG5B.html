<form id="vignetteG2B">

new training protocols: protocol X and protocol Y. Each of these training protocols has been shown to result in significant and long-lasting improvements, but they each work for different people. Unfortunately it is so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. The protocols are are mutually exclusive (i.e. they canâ€™t both be completed at the same time): you must choose one. <br><br>

Which of the following situations would you prefer to be in? <br>
A. Either training protocol X or Y will help you but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br>
B. There is a 50% chance that training protocol X will help you and a 50% chance that training protocol Y will help you. <br><br>
