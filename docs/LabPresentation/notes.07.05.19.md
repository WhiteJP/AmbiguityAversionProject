## notes from meeting with amy --- 7/5/19

- ask questions about how they rate probablitles
- put on number lines
- get to predict results 
- reread all the prior literature (Newell study, Amy study
- do the analsis for variance (it may tell us something about the cause of differences -- is it everybody or is it individual difference. 
- - - prereg,  code, 
change, wording -- instrctions need to change. 


pre-qestion -- a is more likely than b -- must be more 50

If you had to guess, what is the chance that X is the stock that will skyrocket?
number line(0-100)

That means that Y has y% chance of being the stock that will skyrocket. 

Or (preferred)

If you had to guess, hat is the probability that each stock will skyrocket in value?

X:

number line

Y:

number line (move autmatiically so that equals 100%)

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?

Likert scale response. 

Preregister:

we are collecting this confidence variable, not sure, but we may use it to help connecting, but any of those things will be post-hoc. preregister that we are collecting as a DV but any analyses will be post-hoc. 

Amy going away in two weeks if I can do it before then.
