# Ideas and comments after discussion in Lab Meeting

* could just ask people what probability they ascribe to ambiguous situations to directly get to their prior
* could try to do it for political domains and see if people ascribe their priors differently
* look at within vignette variance. Does it differ for losses or gains
* could tell them the information is a lie, and see if people still prefer it. 
* could change it from 50:50, to see at what point thier is indifference between the options
* does the phrase "50, 50" really communcate 50% in each. 
* think about real world application / justification for project. 
* systematic result for positives (and overall) suggests that people don;t assign their priors differently. (charles comments re framing of study). 
* preference for information better to say than risk preference
* to what extent are we getting away from numerical probabilities?
