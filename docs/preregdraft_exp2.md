# Experiment 2 Preregistration Draft

### 1. Have any data been collected for this study already?

No, no data have been collected for this study yet.

### 2. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?

This experiment is a follow up to our previous experiment (AsPredicted Submission #20731, 'Ambiguity Aversion: A Vignette Study -- University of Melbourne 2019'). 

The aim of the present experiment includes the 2 aims mentioned for experiment 1. However, we seek to add:  
    
1.  Can the degree of ambiguity aversion shown in relation to life-like vignettes which involve qualitative gains and losses be predicted by the prior probabilities participants assign under ambiguity. 

Hypothesis: There will be less ambiguity aversion (and possibly even ambiguity seeking) for vignettes for which  participants assign greater probability to the more positive outcome (whether this be neutral in comparison to a loss, or positive in comparison to a gain) than to the more negative outcome. 

### 3. Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured.

The key dependent variable, ambiguity aversion, has already been measured in our previous experiment (see AsPredicted Submission #20731 for details). In this experiment, we will be measuring the probabilities that people assign to the outcomes in these vignettes to see whether this can be used to predict the degree of ambiguity aversion shown in experiment 1. 

To collect this information, participants will be shown the exact same vignettes as in experiment 1. In each of these vignettes, there are two outcomes. Participants will be advised that one (but not both) of these outcomes must occur but the exact probabilities are unknown. Participants will then be asked to guess what the probabilities of these outcomes are. Participants will assign a whole percentage value (from 0% to 100%) to each of these outcomes. Participants responses will be forced to add to 100% in real time. 

Following this participants will be asked how confident they are in their answer.

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
- Not at all confident (0)
- Slightly confident (1)
- Somewhat confident  (2)
- Reasonably confident (3) 
- Extremely confident (4)


### 4. How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?

Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 24 vignettes, half of
which are 'gain' scenarios and half of which are 'loss' scenarios. 

### 5. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.

We will conduct both Bayesian and the analogous Frequentist statistical
analyses.


### 6. Any secondary analyses?

Depending on the results of the above we may undertake further post hoc
analysis, but will clearly indicate that these are post hoc and
exploratory.

In addition to the main DV being collected (discussed above) we are also collecting a confidence

we are collecting this confidence variable, not sure, but we may use it to help connecting, but any of those things will be post-hoc. preregister that we are collecting as a DV but any analyses will be post-hoc. 

### 7. How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size?

We will run the experiment on 1200 people on Amazon Mechanical Turk who
have been pre-screened for English language ability via the Adelaide
Basic Qualification. A sample size of 1200 should average about 50
responses per vignette, although since allocation is random exact
numbers are not
guaranteed.

### 8. Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)

There are two exclusion criteria:

1.  Before being presented with the vignette of interest, participants will be presented a 'dummy' vignette. In this dummy vignette, situation A is much more likely than situation B.  Participants will be given the same sliding scale to make their response as in the actual vignettes, which indicate how likely they believe each situation is. Participants that assign a probability for situation A that is 50% or less will be excluded on the grounds that they have failed to understand the task or are not paying attention. The vignette is shown below.

You are planning on attending an outdoor, uncovered event this afternoon and you are interested in knowing whether it will rain. The weather forecast from multiple sources says that it is very likely to rain. Further, you look out the window and see heavy, dark, threatening rain clouds overhead. Both of these pieces of information lead you to believe that it is much more likely to rain than it is not to rain. 

If you had to guess, what is the probability that it will rain and that it will not rain?

2.  Secondly, following completion of the vignette of interest,
    participants will be asked the question, "what was the last question
    about"? Participants will be given a forced choice response, of
    which three answers are clearly incorrect, and one of which is
    clearly correct. Participants who get this questions incorrect will
    be excluded on the grounds that they failed to read the vignette
    carefully enough.
