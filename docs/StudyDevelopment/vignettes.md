## 'Gain' vignettes

1. You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: X and Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received a reliable tip that only one of your stocks is about to skyrocket in value, although he doesn’t know which one. Unfortunately, you must sell one of the stocks immediately because of a recent medical emergency. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.  There is a 50% chance that Stock X will skyrocket and a 50% chance that Stock Y will skyrocket.
    
    B.  Either stock X or Y will skyrocket in value but the exact probability for each is unknown.
<br><br/>

2. You are currently unemployed, but have just been offered two jobs from two different companies: company X and company Y. You have heard that one of them is in line to receive a great deal of investor funding within the next year, but you don't know which one. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that company X will receive significant investor funding and a 50% chance that company Y will recieve significant investor funding. 
    
    B.	Either company X or company Y will receive significant investor funding but the exact probability for each is unknown.

[JPW comment: reading this one again, I am a little worried that it might not be seen as a gain now; but as a loss, just a future loss when one company originally goes out of business.]
    
<br><br/>

3. You have just been offered a promotion at work along with the choice of becoming head of department X or head of department Y. Your boss tells you that the CEO of the company is planning on putting a lot of resources towards only one of these departments, but your boss does not know which one the CEO has in mind. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.  There is a 50% chance that department X will be supported and a 50% chance that department Y will be supported.
    
    B.  Either department X or department Y will be highly supported but the exact probability for each is unknown.
<br><br/> 


* 4.	You have two friends, X and Y. You have a strong crush on X and no romantic interest at all in Y. A mutual friend of yours, Bob, tells you that he heard that either X or Y was interested in you but doesn't remember which one it was. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that person X is interested and a 50% chance that person Y is interested. 
    
    B.	Either person X or person Y is interested but the exact probability for each is unknown.
<br><br/> 

5.	You are a competitive runner. Your coach has recently returned from a sports science conference and advises you that she has been informed of two new training protocols: protocol X and protocol Y. Each of these training protocols has been shown to result in significant and long-lasting improvements, but they each work for different people. Unfortunately it so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. The protocols are are mutually exclusive (i.e. they can’t both be completed at the same time): you must choose one. Which of the following situations would you prefer?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that training protocol X will help you and a 50% chance that training protocol Y will help you. 
    
    B.	Either training protocol X or Y will help you but the exact probability for each is unknown.
<br><br/> 

6. 	You are invited to two parties on the same night. You have heard that the person you are romantically interested in is definitely attending one of them, but you don’t know which one. Unfortunately, the parties are three hours away from each other, so you cannot attend both. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that the person will be at a party X and a 50% chance that the person will be at party Y. 
    
    B.	The person will be at either party X or party Y but the exact probability for each is unknown.

[JPW note: on rereading this, Im not sure if it clearly relates to a gain.]
<br><br/> 

* 7. [was the election one, I don't think we can make this convincingly a gain in a way that the other is a loss]
You are in the market to buy a house and have identified two that you really like, X and Y. Your real estate agent tells you that the local government is planning on building an amazing school in the neighbourhood of either X or Y, which would greatly increase its property values (and is also very appealing to you since you are planning a family). Unfortunately no decision has made at this point about where it will be built, and you need to put an offer in now in order to get either house. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that the school will be built in X, and a 50% chance that it will be built in Y. 
    
    B.	The school will be built in either X or Y but the exact probability for each is unknown. 
<br><br/> 

8. Your friend has set you up on a blind date. When you arrive at the arranged meeting place you notice that there are two people who fit the general description that your friend has given to you. You find one of these people, person X, extremely attractive; while the other person, person Y, is of only average attractiveness. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

[JPW: changed this to X Y format]

9. Your child has extreme talent and interest in two things: X and Y. You have heard that in a few years a local rich person is planning on funding a very generous scholarship for talented young people in either X or Y. However, at this point they have not decided whether to support X or Y. In order for your child to be eligible they will need to receive specialised training starting now, and the skills are sufficiently time-consuming that they need to pick just one. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that X will get the generous scholarship, and a 50% chance that Y will get the generous scholarship.
    
    B.	Either X or Y will get the generous scholarship, but the exact probability for each is unknown.  
<br><br/> 

10. At a casino, there is an urn on the table which contains 1000 balls. Each of these 1000 balls is either red or yellow. You are to randomly select one of these balls from the urn and, if you selct a red ball, you will win $1000. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that the selected ball will be red, and a 50% chance the selected ball will be yellow.

Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that the rare bird is at preserve X, and a 50% chance that the rare bird is at preserve Y. 
    
    B.	The rare bird is at either preserve X or preserve Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown.  
<br><br/> 

12. You are a medical student and final exams are two weeks away. You have recently been told about two study drugs, drug X and drug Y, which if taken during study can significantly improve memory retention. Both drugs have been shown to work very well, but each works for different people. Unfortunately it so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. Further, both drugs are slow acting, so you only have time to try one before your exams commence. Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that drug X will improve your memory retention, and a 50% chance that drug Y will improve your memory retention. 
    
    B.	Either drug X or Drug Y will improve your memory retention, but the exact probability for each is unknown.

## 'Loss' vignettes

1.	You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: stock X and stock Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received an anonymous tip that one of your stocks is about to plummet in value, while the other will continue to grow steadily.

He cannot tell which one without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because they are very territorial and will fight each other off. An infestation of species X will ruin the structural integrity of the house and cause it to plummet in value. Species Y, however, is completely benign and will impose no costs (financial, aesthetic, or otherwise) to your property.  Which of the following situations would you rather be in?

    A.	There is a 50% chance that the infestation is of species X and a 50% chance that the infestation is of species Y.

You have heard that the local schools are planning on discontinuing programs in either X or Y in a few years due to lack of funds; however, at this point they have not decided which one to eliminate.
