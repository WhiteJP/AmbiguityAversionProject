## Ellsberg's "Two-Urn Paradox" (1961) {.flexbox .vcenter .build}

![](ext_images\urns.png) 
<br>

Each urn contains 100 balls. <br>
Every ball is either white or black. 

<br>
You are to randomly draw a ball from one of these urns. If the ball is white, you win $100. <br>
<br>
__Which urn do you choose?__ 

## Some Distinctions {.build}

Risk: 

> - A __measurable__ lack of certainty represented by numerical probabilities
> - E.g., "there is a 50% chance that it will rain tomorrow"
> - Urn A

Uncertainty:

> - An __unmeasurable__ lack of certainty 
> - E.g., "there is an unknown probability that it will rain tomorrow" 
> - Urn B

Ambiguity Aversion (AA):

> - The preference for "risk" over "uncertainty", independent of utility. 
> - E.g. the robust finding that people, on average, prefer urn A over urn B. 

## The Ambiguity Aversion Literature

* Economists showing off thier math skills trying to model AA. 
* Successful, yet often narrow in focus. 
* More or less confined to:
    * Contrived economic games & bets (e.g., the urns)
    * Applications in financial decisions and markets. 
    * Overtly quantitative domains. 
* But how does ambiguity affect other decisions that cant be easily quantified, when utility can't be easily measured?

## AA and Qualitative domains

* Very sparse literature here, but AA has been found to arise in:
    * Medical contexts 
        * Choices to undergo medical procedures (Curley et. al., 1984; Bier & Connell, 1994)
        * Choices to vaccinate (Ritov & Baron, 1990)
    * Decisions on where to live (Viscusi et al., 1991)
* No systematic treatment of this (that I know of).
* This is where we come in! We want to find out:

1. Does ambiguity aversion systematically arise in qualitative ‘real-world’ situations in a variety of different contexts and scenarios? 
2. Is the degree of ambiguity aversion different for gains and losses?

## Study Design {.build}

* Participants (*N* = 1200, MTurk sample) presented with one qualitative vignette.
* Then shown two different situations in relation to the vignette --- one "ambiguous", one "risky". 
* Asked "which of these two situations you would rather be in"
* Respond on 7-point Likert scale, coded so that 3 = Ambiguity Aversion, 0 = Neutrality, -3 = Ambiguity Seeking. 
* 24 different vignettes, all of differing contexts: social, workplace, romantic, health, family etc. 
* 12 "gain" vignettes, 12 "loss" vignettes.

## Statistical Analyses 

- We ran the following ordinal logistic regressions on this preference:
    (a) No predictors. (AA overall?)<br>
    (b) Predictor including a main effect of condition, that is whether it is gain or loss. (AA modulated by gain or loss?) <br>
    (c) Predictor including a main effect of order of the option. (Ensure answer order doesn't affect responses) <br>
    (d) Predictor including a main effect of condition plus a random intercept of question.(Does AA vary by situation?) <br>  
    (e) Post-hoc model with only a random effect for intercept by vignette, to see whether condition (gain or loss) predictor adds anything beyond random effect. <br>

- Compare AIC to select best model. 
- Ran both Bayesian and Frequentist versions of models.

```

## Freq: Comparing the models

The AIC values for our different models are :

> - No Predictors:          `r AIC(olm.freq.nopred)` 
> - Gain or Loss Predictor: `r AIC(olm.freq.GLpred)` 
> - Answer order Predictor: `r AIC(olm.freq.ordpred)`
> - Mixed model:            `r AIC(olmm.freq)` (i.e. random intercept by vignette and fixed GL Predictor)
> - Only Random Intercept:  `r AIC(olm.freq.onlyrand)` (post-hoc)

Best model by AIC is the Mixed Model, according with the general findings in the Ambiguity Aversion literature. 

## Conclusions

* Broadly confirms the conclusions of the present AA literature
* Extends the findings to a variety of different qualitative contexts and situations 
* AA more prevalent in relation to gains than losses, although most of the variaition
* The degree of AA present differs considerably in relation to the circumstances at hand.

The WAIC values for our different models are :

> - No Predictors:          `r WAIC(olm.bayes.nopred)$estimates[3,1]` 
> - Gain or Loss Predictor: `r WAIC(olm.bayes.GLpred)$estimates[3,1]` 
> - Answer order Predictor: `r WAIC(olm.bayes.ordpred)$estimates[3,1]` 
> - Mixed model:            `r WAIC(olmm.bayes)$estimates[3,1]` (i.e. random intercept by vignette and fixed GL Predictor)
> - Only Random Intercept:  `r WAIC(olm.bayes.onlyrand)$estimates[3,1]` (post-hoc)

Again --- best model is Mixed model. 

## Urn vignette Analysis 

Lastly, to ensure that our study replicates the existing effect with our new methodology, (using a likert response to show preference as opposed to pricing options or asking for a simple force choice preference), two of our vignettes (one for gain and one for loss) were direct replications of the urn phenomenon. For example:

![](ext_images\qexample3.PNG) 


## Urn Vignette results { .flexbox .vcenter }

```{r urn-plot}
##filter dataset to contain only urn vignettes
d_pass_urns <- d_pass %>% filter(vignette == "G10" | vignette == "L7")

```{r frequentist-analysis-urns, include = FALSE}
olm.freq.nopred.urns <-  polr(vignetteAnswer.ordfac ~ 1, data = d_pass_urns,
                              method = "logistic", Hess = TRUE) 
olm.freq.GLpred.urns <-  polr(vignetteAnswer.ordfac ~ vignetteType, data = d_pass_urns,

## AIC values
The AIC values for our two different frequentist models are:

> - `r AIC(olm.freq.nopred.urns)` for the model with no predictors 
> - `r AIC(olm.freq.GLpred.urns)` for the model with Gain or Loss as a predictor

These values illustrate that the existing effect is replicated in our findings. Firstly, ambiguity aversion exists in both gains and loss variants of the classic urn task. Secondly, the degree of ambiguity aversion is affected by whether we are discussing domains of loss or gain --- ambiguity aversion is stronger for gains than for losses. 

## Bayesian

```{r bayesian-analysis-urns, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
olm.bayes.nopred.urns <- brm(vignetteAnswer.ordfac ~ 1, data = d_pass_urns, family = cumulative(link = "logit"), 
                         refresh = 0, open_progress = FALSE)  #to suppress progress printing to screen for .Rmd
olm.bayes.GLpred.urns <- brm(vignetteAnswer.ordfac ~ vignetteType, data = d_pass_urns, family = cumulative(link = "logit"), 
                         refresh = 0, open_progress = FALSE) 

summary(olm.bayes.nopred.urns)
summary(olm.bayes.GLpred.urns)
```

## WAIC values
The WAIC values for our four different Bayesian models are (I was not able to easily extract the AIC from these models):

> - No Predictor Model:       `r WAIC(olm.bayes.nopred.urns)$estimates[3,1]` 
> - Gain/Loss Predictor Model:`r WAIC(olm.bayes.GLpred.urns)$estimates[3,1]`
