### How to apply for ethics at the University of Melbourne
Ethics is an annoying but necessary (and often useful) precursor to running any experiment at all, so it is very important that you build "applying for ethics" into your natural workflow and take it seriously. This document describes how you should go about doing this application. 

#### Who needs to apply for ethics?
You should be applying for ethics for *your project* if you are an honours, masters, or PhD student (you will list everyone else involved in your project when you apply). Because it is your project you are the Responsible Researcher.

#### Filling out the associated ethics documents
There are two main parts of applying for ethics. One is filling out a (long and tedious) form on Themis and the other is filling out four documents whose templates can be found in this folder: the main application, PLS, consent, and debrief. Within the documents, instructions for how to deal with particularly tricky bits are indicated in dark blue font. Be sure to remove the instructions before submitting them! As for Themis, read on...

#### Applying for ethics on Themis
Your first step is just to get onto themis. You should have a Themis account if you are affliated with the University of Melbourne. You can find it if you go to this url: [http://themis.unimelb.edu.au/](http://themis.unimelb.edu.au/). Note that for some reason Themis doesn't play nicely with Chrome; I usually open it in Safari.

In Themis, click "Log into Themis". Then choose "UOM Research Self Service" from the folders on the left, and from there choose "Ethics" and then "Human Ethics Workbench." Choose the Create button under "Create new Documents." If you are a student of any flavour (including PhD) you should choose "Supervised Student Research Project"; if you are a postdoc or other staff, you should choose "Staff Research Project."

There follows a series of pages designed to determine whether our work is minimal risk or not. Most of the possibilities do not apply to us, but read them carefully to be sure. Two that usually do apply are:
* Locations other than / in addition to UniMelb (if you are going to use MTurk or something similar). Later in the form it will ask you where it will be held; say "Other" and then describe Mechanical Turk briefly. Ethics committees are used to this, it will be fine.
* Funded research (if we are paying for participants it is funded; if REP it may not be and you should check). It is *not*, however, being funded by an overseas agency unless we have explicitly told you it is already. Later the form will ask you if the participants are aware of the funding; answer yes and indicate it on the PLS/consent as in the template documents. If it is externally funded it will ask you for the sponsor; it is almost certainly Australian Research Council unless your supervisor has told you otherwise.

Select Minimal Risk when it asks unless you have a previously had a conversation with one of us suggesting that you should do otherwise. At some point on Themis you will be given an ID number. This should go in your documents.

There will be a question about procedures, and in almost all cases none of the procedures apply (e.g., recording without consent / infliction of pain / use of drugs / etc). The closest that might is "deception of participants". You should answer yes to this if part of the experiment requires deceiving them in a substantial way (e.g., giving them inaccurate feedback about their own performance). Simply failing to mention the entire purpose of the experiment or the nature of all of the conditions in advance does not constitute deception; this is how experiments work. Our research does not generally target any special or vulnerable populations and has no risks to the researcher either.

For the Project Details you will want to select Psychological Sciences as the responsible HEAG and come up with a title that is explanatory to you but is also helpful for participants (since your title will be at the top of the consent form and other documents). 

Choose a project duration that is much longer than you envision. You can always extend it if you need to but having it longer saves you from that additional step in the event that something goes wrong (data collection takes longer than you need, you need to rerun a condition, etc). I generally suggest at least a year if not two.

Add everyone associated with the project as associated researchers. If you are a student, your main supervisor is the Responsible Researcher.

Later it will ask if approvals from external bodies are required, or ethics approvals are required: the answer is almost always "no" because it's asking about *above and beyond* this application. E.g. if you were going into schools you might say "yes" because you need permission of the schools, but running experiments of the sort we do (online, or with psych students) this is usually not necessary.

Then it will ask you to submit your Application Form and attachments - these are the filled-out (and SIGNED!!) templates from above. You should submit them as four separate documents: Application Form, consent, PLS, and debriefing.

IMPORTANT! After submitting it on Themis you *are not done*. Read on!

#### Final application step
Once you have submitted the application on Themis you still need to email it as one ginormous pdf, complete with cover page, to the ethics committee. To do this follow the following steps:

1. Click on "View" for your Ethics application. You should see a menu on the left. From it, choose "Printable Summary Report". This should download a PDF.

2. Combine the following documents into one PDF in the following order: summary report, application form, pls, consent, debrief). You can do this using preview or similar software, or using free online tools like PDF merge.

3. Email the full PDF to ethics-psych@unimelb.edu.au. In the subject line indicate the ethics ID of the application and note that you submitted it via Themis already and it is minimal risk.

4. Within a week or two you should get either requests for changing elements of this or approval. If you get requests, please try to change them quickly as if you're not careful this part of the process can really drag things out. Note that you will need to create a new PDF and send it back for every request you get. If more than two weeks go by you should follow up (*very* politely) to make sure nothing got lost and you didn't do anything wrong.

5. When you get approval, make sure all of your collaborators have a copy of the approval document and you have put it into your "ethics" folder along with all your other ethics documents.

#### Annual report
If you are the responsible researcher, you will be required to submit an annual report at the end of every year for every ethics application you filed during that year. (You'll get a nagging email so don't worry about it until then). To submit it, go to Themis and then to "Human Ethics Workbench" and select the item under "Annual Reports Due". There are about five pages of fairly straightforward questions.


You will see the Annual Report on your Human Ethics Workbench under the heading 'Annual Reports Due'. Click on the 'Update' icon to submit the report on-line.
