<form id="vignetteL1">

There is an urn on the table which contains 1000 balls. Each of these 1000 balls is either red or yellow. You are to randomly select one of these balls from the urn and, if you select a red ball, you will lose $1000. The selected ball will be either red or yellow, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the selected ball will be red? What is the probability that it will be yellow? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the selected ball will be red is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the selected ball will be yellow is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
