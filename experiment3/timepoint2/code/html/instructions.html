As mentioned, this experiment involves making choices between different options. However, unlike many studies which ask you to make a choice about <i>what you would do</i> in a certain situation, this experiment asks you to make a choice about which hypothetical situation <b><i>you would rather be in</i></b>.<br><br>

Here's how it will work in a little more depth. You will be presented with 11 short, life-like scenarios which we call 'vignettes'. After reading each vignette, you will be shown two different possibilities for what the true underlying situation in the vignette is. For each vignette we are interested in which of these two situations <b><i>you would rather be in</i></b>. You will answer on a scale from "I would definitely rather be in situation A" to "I would definitely rather be in situation B" with "I am indifferent about which situation I would rather be in" in the middle.  <br><br>

We are interested in how people think about this kind of thing. As such there is no "right" answer and we just ask that you take it seriously and think carefully. There are only two questions so please take your time for each. <br><br>

<b>NOTE: Many of these vignettes look similar to each other, but they are all different. Please read each one closely, as the subtle differences might affect your choices! </b><br><br>
