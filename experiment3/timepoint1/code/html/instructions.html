As mentioned, this experiment involves guessing the probability of different options. Unlike many studies which ask you to make a choice about <i>what you would do</i> in a certain situation, this experiment asks you respond with <b><i>how likely you believe a situation is</i></b>.<br><br>

Here's how it will work in a little more depth. You will be presented with 11 short, life-like scenarios which we call 'vignettes'. Each vignette describes two possible situations, one of which is true and one of which is false. You will be asked to tell us how likely you believe each situation in the vignette is. You will answer on a sliding scale from "0%", meaning you believe the situation is impossible, to "100%", meaning you believe the situation is certain. <br><br>

Both these probablities must total 100% (because, as stated above, one of the situations is definitely true and one is definitely false). But don't worry, the probabilites will automatic adjust to ensure this happens. Lastly, you will be asked how confident you are about these answers.<br><br>

We are interested in how people think about this kind of thing. As such there is no "right" answer and we just ask that you take it seriously and think carefully. There are only two questions so please take your time for each. <br><br>

<b>NOTE: Many of these vignettes look similar to each other, but they are all different. Please read each one closely, as the subtle differences might affect your choices! </b><br><br>
