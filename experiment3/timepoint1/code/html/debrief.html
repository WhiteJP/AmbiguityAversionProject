You have completed part 1 of the experiment. Your code to claim this HIT is <b><span id="subid">SUBID</span></b>.<br><br>

As alredy mentioned, please keep your eyes out for part 2 of this experiment which, if you qualify, we will ask you to complete in approximately 1 week. We will email you via Amazon MTurk when it is available. We will be combining your results from your particpation today with your results from part 2 (should you participate), so we would really appreciate you participation in part 2. However, regardless of whether you return for part 2, you will be paid for your participation today. After the completion of part 2 of the study, we will tell you a little more information about what we are studying and what this experiment was about. <br><br>

As always, we are very grateful to the thoughtful data you provide, as it tells us a great deal about how humans think and reason.<BR><BR>
