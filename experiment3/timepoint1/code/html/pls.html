<h4>Introduction</h4>
This project focuses on understanding people’s preferences and decision-making when faced with risk and uncertainty. We’re interested in understanding the kinds of reasoning people actually go through so you should try to give natural and intuitive responses without overthinking.

<h4>What will I be asked to do?</h4>
You'll be randomly assigned to an experimental condition corresponding to 11 simple vignettes (a short description of a life-like scenario). In all conditions, your task will be to respond with how likely you think the events related to the vignette are.  

<h4>What are the risks?</h4>
Risks are minimal. The experiment does take around 15 minutes and thus represents a time investment. We hope the experiment may be thought-provoking and interesting, but there is some chance you will find it boring.  The vignettes presented are hypothetical, general and from familiar categories of everyday experience, so they are unlikely to cause you distress. However, if you think that you may be frightened or distressed by these vignettes, you should not participate.

<h4>What are the benefits?</h4>
Relatively little is still known about how people’s choices and decision-making occur in situations like those we’re looking at. Our long-term goal is to identify what preferences people hold under risk and uncertainty, why they hold these preferences, and to see if we can improve how people make decisions in these situations. You will be paid for your contribution upon completion of the experiment.

<h4>How would my confidentiality be protected?</h4>
As an Amazon Worker, we will not be tracking any identifying information like IP address. Our sample size will be large, making it even more difficult to identify any one person.

<h4>What if I want to withdraw from the Research?</h4>
Participation in this research is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time without penalty (other than not getting paid). Your data will not be used in the full sample unless you complete the experiment.

<h4>Where can I get further information?</h4>
