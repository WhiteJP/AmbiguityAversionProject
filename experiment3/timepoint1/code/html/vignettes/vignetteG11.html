<form id="vignetteG1A">

You have one day left of your vacation, and within a few hours' driving distance from your hotel are two different wildlife preserves: preserve X and preserve Y. There is a rare bird, one of the only ones of its kind, that has been spotted in both X and Y. The bird cannot be in two places at once and you do not have time to go to both. The rare bird will be in either preserve X or preserve Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the rare bird will be in either wildlife preserve? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that probability that the rare bird will be in one preserve is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability it will be in the other preserve is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
