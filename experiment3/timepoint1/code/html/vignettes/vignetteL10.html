<form id="vignetteL2A">

On a routine doctor visit, you learn that your body has acquired a pathogen with two possible variants: variant X and variant Y. Your doctor cannot determine which it is without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because each one kills the other. Variant X is potentially deadly while variant Y is known to becompletely harmless with no negative effects. The pathogen is of either variant X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the pathogen is of variant X (potentially deadly) or variant Y (completely harmless)? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability the pathogen is of variant X (potentially deadly) is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the pathogen is of variant Y (completely harmless) is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
