chm535yz8nr,G3y,G,3,y,G3,3,90,10,0,50,50,female,32,correct,"I chose the answer I did because I viewed the question as a statistical about which one is more likely to be the one that is heavily financed.  Since I didn't have any information that would favor one or the other, I thought that from the viewpoint of having no information for the odds would mean it could go 50-50 from my viewpoint.  At first, I thought the question was asking what was the likelihood that one department would be favored over the odd and I answered 40% that one department would be heavily financed versus 60% that one department would not be heavily financed because I know that bosses lie for their own benefit a lot, however, after re-reading the question I decided that the question was actually asking what I outlined previously (first) in this paragraph.  However, I did find the question a little confusing, and I'm not sure I actually understood the question the way I was supposed to, so that is why I said I had no confidence in my answer."

I almost set the slider to 50/50 because I would have a 50/50 chance of getting the one that worked, but the question asked what the percentage chance that one would significantly improve my performance.  Because they are mutually exclusive, I chose an almost certain chance that one would work while the other would not."

Did the casino set this game up so that a player could only win by picking a red ball, or was each player allowed to choose which color they expected to pick?  This was a glaring detail that should have been included, because it would have affected how I answered.  If the casino only allowed red balls to win, as I was forced to assume, then there would clearly be less than 50% chance of a ball being red.  If players were allowed to choose for themselves, then there would probably have been a 50% chance of winning."
