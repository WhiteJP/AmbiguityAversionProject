o2lc35yzcpg,L7A,L,7,A,L7,7,2,male,51,correct,I prefer to know the specific odds
7emt35yz8gy,L11B,L,11,B,L11,7,1,female,35,correct,NA
go6e35yzl0i,L4B,L,4,B,L4,7,6,male,49,correct,I'd prefer to know the probability that each option would get discontinued. I was thinking 50/50 is better than not knowing the odds.
pawc35yzk9o,G10A,G,10,A,G10,7,2,female,24,correct,The possibility percentage was the same for each answer but there was something about seeing the actual percentage that made the choice more appealing.
rs7g35yz9py,L12B,L,12,B,L12,7,4,female,42,correct,With A it could be 50/50 as well so either one would have been an answer for me.
7nql35yzygy,L1A,L,1,A,L1,7,2,male,75,correct,probably 50% situation rather than x%
kx9135yz6xs,L11B,L,11,B,L11,7,4,female,50,correct,NA
dp5j35yz3yf,G5B,G,5,B,G5,7,5,female,35,correct,I would slightly prefer that the probabilities would be equal because if they weren't and I chose the 'wrong' one I feel like I would regret my choice more. With 50/50 it's a coin toss.
21ls35yzp09,L6B,L,6,B,L6,7,6,male,31,correct,NA

l10835yz2j9,L12A,L,12,A,L12,7,4,female,41,correct,"It seems like either could potentially be comparable (since B was unknown). It could also be more or less than A, so I chose the middle option."
dl5j35yzwoa,G1B,G,1,B,G1,7,7,male,34,correct,I prefer situations where I know the exact statistics of the situation verses situations where the probabilities are unknown.
lo0x35yzk19,G12A,G,12,A,G12,6,6,female,44,correct,"My reasoning was: With A, there's a 50% chance that it'll help, but then to me, that means there's a 50% chance that it won't. I'd therefore rather go with B that promises memory retention but with no guarantee of the percentage."
vpf235yz055,G10A,G,10,A,G10,7,4,female,48,correct,NA
dsde35yzkbw,L11B,L,11,B,L11,7,4,male,37,correct,It was a 50% shot either way
gz1s35yzd52,L6B,L,6,B,L6,7,4,female,47,correct,There wasn't any difference in choices in my opinion so I chose indifferent.
qu5d35yzmzk,L10B,L,10,B,L10,7,2,female,50,correct,I was thinking that is was best if I did not know which it was so that I would not worry about it.
kpjd35yz4hy,G3A,G,3,A,G3,7,1,female,38,correct,"I was thinking that with that option, there would be a 50/50 chance, which I would like better than the unknown percentage chance of the other option."

6vwv35yz7tv,G8B,G,8,B,G8,7,7,male,49,correct,"I chose that answer, because there was at least a 50% chance that person X the one that I was interested in is interested in me. I like those odds, its much better than 49% or zero chance! :)"
xbk235yzrpj,L10B,L,10,B,L10,7,1,female,33,correct,"I would rather not know the percentages if it was a 50/50 chance.  I would constantly wonder which it could be, whereas if I don't know the percentage I wouldn't focus as much on it."

sghz35yzg8u,G3A,G,3,A,G3,7,4,male,28,correct,Because I truly was indifferent to both options. They both seemed equally appealing to me.

ut9i35yzs7r,G10B,G,10,B,G10,7,3,male,39,correct,"I think that I would slightly prefer to not have an even chance of my crush being at one party or the other. That way, regardless of the outcome I can feel free to blame or praise the odds for the result."
qenw35yznkm,G11A,G,11,A,G11,7,2,male,23,correct,Knowing the probability makes me more comfortable
cm2035yzi1g,G10B,G,10,B,G10,7,4,male,28,correct,"Because it would be a guessing game either way, I was indifferent to the possibilities that were presented."

q6ca35yzn5l,G3B,G,3,B,G3,7,6,female,33,correct,"I would prefer to know the odds beforehand, even if there was no way to know the outcome."
9fpx35yzsr0,L4B,L,4,B,L4,7,4,female,44,correct,I think that both answers were equally undesirable as neither one would really help you to make a decision.
rdxr35yzrte,G9B,G,9,B,G9,7,5,male,55,correct,I leaned toward option B because I figured a 50-50 chance was good even odds and the other may be very unbalanced.
qsd635yz4im,G2B,G,2,B,G2,7,4,female,29,correct,"Either way, to me, it would be the same outcome regardless of probability. Either it's X or Y."
7nku35yz2rg,G10A,G,10,A,G10,6,4,female,45,correct,Its difficult to decide which option to be in so i will just follow fate.
ktb035yzw6x,G3A,G,3,A,G3,7,4,male,30,correct,NA
r90235yz85p,G6B,G,6,B,G6,7,2,female,56,correct,"I think since I had a 50/50 chance of selecting either employer, I preferred that the odds were the same that each company would get funding."
rxva35yz3rw,L9A,L,9,A,L9,7,4,male,44,correct,"The odds seemed to be about the same, so it was mostly pointless to choose..."
fxf935yzfg3,L3B,L,3,B,L3,7,6,female,55,correct,I think I would like to know the percentages rather than it being ambiguous.

ihk135yz1lm,G9B,G,9,B,G9,7,6,male,33,correct,I chose option B because I feel as though there is a 50/50 chance and either direction would work wonderfully.

nlqj35yzfy2,L11B,L,11,B,L11,7,2,male,39,correct,I guess I felt a little better not having exact odds placed on it. I was thinking my odds might be 60 or 70 percent since no number was stated in that option. I felt like there was a higher chance my car did not get hit or at least I was trying to positively will it to be that way.
lxen35yz47t,G5B,G,5,B,G5,7,6,male,57,correct,"It simplifies everything. With the available information, there's no real way to make an intelligent decision on which stock to sell. A 50% chance for each one is simple, so I prefer that one."
1ahb35yzpav,L6A,L,6,A,L6,7,2,female,56,correct,I preferred the 50-50 odds.
vclj35yz90g,L6A,L,6,A,L6,7,4,female,43,correct,"I thought about which option would be beneficial to me.  So for the first question, I chose the house that was on a hill, that way I wouldn't get flooded.  In the second, neither option really would change my outcome."
dyk235yzdz3,G1A,G,1,A,G1,7,5,female,46,correct,"If I didn't win, I think it would be better to not know what my odds were than to know the odds are 50/50 and I chose wrong."
qxqv35yzeti,G12A,G,12,A,G12,7,1,male,29,correct,I'd rather have a 50:50 shot at the drug I choose working than an unknown probability.
8emr35yzrql,L9B,L,9,B,L9,7,2,female,36,correct,I figured my odds were a little better than the 50/50.  I wanted to remain optimistic that the outcome for me having the easier virus
a5t635yzb22,G9A,G,9,A,G9,7,1,male,33,correct,"The first option gave the most information. If I did a protocol and it didn't work, I would know the other one would, and that everyone else is equally in the same boat as I."
hab235yz7dn,L9B,L,9,B,L9,7,4,male,55,correct,"The result is the same either way, it either has one or the other. If the probabilities are unknown to me , then they are effectively equal to me. There is nothing I can do about it."

hgc935yz7ug,L6B,L,6,B,L6,7,7,male,32,correct,I would rather know the chances of a branch closure so that I could make future plans if I was laid off.
3e6c35yztcc,L10A,L,10,A,L10,7,2,male,38,correct,"Since the known was even odds I thought about the possibility that it fell on either side of that, but ultimately I would rather know the probabilities than not know them."

6wfj35yzwo5,G11B,G,11,B,G11,7,4,male,44,correct,"With the odds being unknown, it is effectively 50/50 (even if that is not the real odds), thus I selected no preference."
yhhi35yzn77,L3A,L,3,A,L3,7,3,female,46,correct,"At least with 50/50 odds I'd know that one department wasn't at any more risk than the other; however, if I were a risk taker, I'd probably go with the other option and hope that I'd choose the department with less chance of the budget cut.  I'm just not that brave I suppose."

z55w35yz1ud,G7B,G,7,B,G7,6,3,male,31,correct,Choosing between which neighborhood I would rather be in. There is varying chances that a new school will be built in one of the neighborhoods. I chose improbable because I think it's not much different than 50/50.

I actually tried to reason out which could possibly be better situation, but not really sure either.  Tough question - but good."
