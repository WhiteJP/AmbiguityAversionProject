Since I didn't have any information that would favor one or the other, I thought that from the viewpoint of having no information for the odds would mean it could go 50-50 from my viewpoint.  At first, I thought the question was asking what was the likelihood that one department would be favored over the odd and I answered 40% that one department would be heavily financed versus 60% that one department would not be heavily financed because I know that bosses lie for their own benefit a lot, however, after re-reading the question I decided that the question was actually asking what I outlined previously (first) in this paragraph.  However, I did find the question a little confusing, and I'm not sure I actually understood the question the way I was supposed to, so that is why I said I had no confidence in my answer."

If the casino only allowed red balls to win, as I was forced to assume, then there would clearly be less than 50% chance of a ball being red.
