<h3>Question 1</h3>
</center>

<form id="dummyvignette">

You are planning on attending an outdoor, uncovered event this afternoon and you are interested in knowing whether it will rain. The weather forecast from multiple sources says that it is very likely to rain. Further, you look out the window and see heavy, dark, threatening rain clouds overhead. Both of these pieces of information lead you to believe that it is much more likely to rain than it is not to rain. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that it will rain and the probability that it will not rain? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that it <i>will</i> rain is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability that it will <i>not</i> rain is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
