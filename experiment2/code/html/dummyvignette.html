<h3>Question 1</h3>
</center>

<form id="dummyvignette">

You are planning on attending an outdoor, uncovered event this afternoon and you are interested in knowing whether it will rain. The weather forecast from multiple sources says that it is very likely to rain. Further, you look out the window and see heavy, dark, threatening rain clouds overhead. Both of these pieces of information lead you to believe that it is much more likely to rain than it is not to rain. <br><br>

If you had to guess, what is the probability that it will rain and that it will not rain?<br><br>

According to my guess, the probablity that it <i>will</i> rain is: 

      <div class = "slider" id = "sliderx"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% </div> </center>
<br> 

According to my guess, the probablity  that it <i>will not</i> rain is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "slidery"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id ="inputy"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
