<h3>Question 1</h3>
</center>

<form id="dummyvignette">

You are planning an outdoor event this afternoon for which you hope it will not rain. 
If you had to guess, what is the probability that each stock will skyrocket in value?<br><br>

According to my guess, the probablity that X will skyrocket in value is: 

      <div class = "slider" id = "sliderx"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% </div> </center>
<br> 

According to my guess, the probablity that Y will skyrocket in value is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "slidery"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id ="inputy"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
