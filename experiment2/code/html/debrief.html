<h4>Thank you for participating in our study! </h4>

You have completed the experiment. Your code to claim this HIT is <b><span id="subid">SUBID</span></b>. The study was pretty straightforward so there’s not much more to say, but in case you’re interested in more of the background, here it is:<BR><BR>

As we mentioned earlier, we are researching people’s preferences and decision-making under risk and uncertainty. Specifically, we are interested in what has been labelled 'ambiguity aversion': the tendency for people to prefer situations with clearly defined probabilities (i.e. 'risk') than situations which are not clearly defined by probability (i.e. 'uncertainty'). This phenomenon has been widely studied but has ordinarily been done so with contrived economic games and bets concocted by experimenters that may not be representative of decisions in the 'real world'. <BR><BR>

In this study, we are seeking to ascertain whether ambiguity aversion occurs in (1) more life-like scenarios, (2) a variety of life-like scenarios, and (3) for qualitative as opposed to quantitative scenarios. As such, we will be analyzing the proababilities that you (and all the other participants) ascribed to various ambiguous situations to understand how that relates to, and may help explain, why people often prefer risk to ambiguity. <BR><BR>
  
As always, we are very grateful to the thoughtful data you provide, as it tells us a great deal about how
humans think and reason.<BR><BR>
