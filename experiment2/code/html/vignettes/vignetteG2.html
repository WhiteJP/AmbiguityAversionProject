<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteG2">

You are currently unemployed, but have just been offered two jobs from two different companies: company X and company Y. You have heard that one of them is in line to receive a great deal of investor funding within the next year, but you don't know which one. Either company X or company Y will receive significant investor funding but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

If you had to guess, what is the probability that each company will receive this investor funding? <br><br>

According to my guess, the probablity that company X will receive this investor funding is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "sliderx"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

According to my guess, the probablity that company Y will receive this investor funding is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "slidery"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id ="inputy"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
