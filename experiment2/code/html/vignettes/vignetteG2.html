<form id="vignetteG2">

You are currently unemployed, but have just been offered two jobs from two different companies: company X and company Y. You have heard that one of them is in line to receive a great deal of investor funding within the next year, but you don't know which one. Either company X or company Y will receive significant investor funding but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is probability that each company will receive this investor funding?? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one company will receive this investor funding is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the other will receive this investor funding is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
