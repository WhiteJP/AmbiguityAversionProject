</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

You have two friends, X and Y. You have a strong crush on X and no romantic interest at all in Y. A mutual friend of yours, Bob, tells you that he heard that either X or Y was interested in you but doesn't remember which one it was. That is, either person X or person Y is interested in you but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that X is interested you, and what is the probability that Y is interested in you? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that X is interested in me is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability that Y is interested in me is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
