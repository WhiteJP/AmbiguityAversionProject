<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

You are a competitive runner. Your coach has recently returned from a sports science conference and advises you that she has been informed of two new training protocols: protocol X and protocol Y. Each of these training protocols has been shown to result in significant and long-lasting improvements, but they each work for different people. Unfortunately, it is so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. The protocols are mutually exclusive (i.e. they canâ€™t both be completed at the same time): you must choose one. Either training protocol X or Y will significiantly improve your running time but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each protocol will result in a significant improvement in your running time? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one protocol will result in a significant improvement in my running time is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the other will result in a significant improvement in my running time is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
