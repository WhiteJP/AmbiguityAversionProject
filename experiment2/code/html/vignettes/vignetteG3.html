</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

You have just been offered a promotion at work along with the choice of becoming head of department X or head of department Y. Your boss tells you that his boss is planning on heavily supporting only one of these departments, but he does not know which one his boss has in mind. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each department will be heavily financially supported? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one department will be heavily supported is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the other will be heavily supported is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
