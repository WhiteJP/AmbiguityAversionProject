<form id="vignetteL2A">

You have just been offered a promotion at work along with the choice of becoming head of department X or head of department Y. Your boss tells you that the CEO of the company is planning on slashing the budget of only one of these departments, but your boss does not know which one the CEO has in mind. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the budget will be slased for each department? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one department's budget will be slashed is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability that the other department's budget will be slashed is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
