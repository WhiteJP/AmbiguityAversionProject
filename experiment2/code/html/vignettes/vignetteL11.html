<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

Your child has extreme talent and interest in two things: X and Y. You have heard that the local schools are planning on discontinuing programs in either X or Y in a few years due to lack of funds; however, at this point they have not decided which one to eliminate. You don't have the funds to get your child private lessons, so their only option is through the schools. Neither your nor your child wants to start something that they will have to stop. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that programs will be discontinued for X or Y? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the programs will be discontinued for one is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the programs will be discontinued for the other is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
