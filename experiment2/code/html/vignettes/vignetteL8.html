<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

You have left your car in an uncovered airport carpark while you are travelling to a far away city for work. Since you left, you have heard news that a large hailstorm has struck near the airport but you have not been able to determine exactly where. If this hailstorm hit the airport carpark, your car has probably sustained serious and costly damage (you are uninsured). The hailstorm either struck your car or it didnâ€™t, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that your car has been struck by the hailstorm? What is the probability that your car has not? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that my car has been struck by the hailstorm is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability that it has not been struck by the hailstorm is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
