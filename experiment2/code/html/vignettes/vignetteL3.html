<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

You have developed an insect infestation in your house. The inspector tells you it is either species X or species Y. He cannot tell which one without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because they are very territorial and will fight each other off. An infestation of species X will ruin the structural integrity of the house and cause it to plummet in value. Species Y, however, is completely benign and will impose no costs (financial, aesthetic, or otherwise) to your property.<br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the insect species infecting your house is X or Y? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the insect is of one species is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the insect is of the other species is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
