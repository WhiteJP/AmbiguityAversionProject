<form id="vignetteL2A">

Your computer has a virus. A consultant tells you that it is either of type X or type Y; he cannot tell without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because they cannot operate on the same machine. Virus type X will require your computer to sit at the shop for weeks in order to fix, while Y can be removed in less than an hour.<br><br>

Which of the following situations would you rather be in? <br>
A. There is a 50% chance that your computer has virus X, and a 50% chance that your computer has virus Y.<br>
B. Your computer has either virus X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>
