<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

You are a medical student and final exams are two weeks away. You have recently been told about two study drugs, drug X and drug Y, which if taken during study can significantly improve memory retention. Both drugs have been shown to work very well, but each works for different people. Unfortunately, it is so far impossible to determine ahead of time which people will benefit from which. Further, both drugs are slow acting, so you only have time to try one before your exams commence. Either drug X or Drug Y will improve your memory retention, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each drug will significantly improve your memory retention? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one drug will improve my memory retention is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the other will improve my memory retention is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
