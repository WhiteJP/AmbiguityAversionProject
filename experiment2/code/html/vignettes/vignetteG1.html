<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteG1">

You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: X and Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received a reliable tip that only one of your stocks is about to skyrocket in value, although he doesn't know which one. Unfortunately, you must sell one of the stocks immediately because of a recent medical emergency. Either stock X or Y will skyrocket in value but the exact probability for each is unknown.<br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each stock will skyrocket in value? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one stock will skyrocket is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the other will skyrocket is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
