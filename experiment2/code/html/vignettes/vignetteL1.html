<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL1">

You have a stock portfolio of two stocks: stock X and stock Y.  You get a call from your stockbroker who advises you that he has received an anonymous tip that one of your stocks is about to plummet in value, while the other will continue to grow steadily. Due to taxation and investment regulations, you can only sell one of these stocks. Either stock X or Y will plummet in value, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

If you had to guess, what is the probability that each stock will plummet in value? <br><br>

According to my guess, the probablity that stock X will plummet in value is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "sliderx"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

According to my guess, the probablity that stock Y will plummet in value is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "slidery"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id ="inputy"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
