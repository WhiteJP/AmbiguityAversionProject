<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

You work at a bank and are moving to a new city that has two branches of this bank, branch X and branch Y. Your boss is willing to transfer you to either X or Y in your new city. However, the bank's CEO has announced that within two years one of these branches will be closed because the city is only big enough to sustain one branch, and the employees of the closed branch will be made redundant. Either branch X or Y will be closed, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each branch will close down? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that one branch will close is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the the other branch will close is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
