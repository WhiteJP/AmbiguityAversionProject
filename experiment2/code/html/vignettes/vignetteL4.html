<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

Your computer has a virus. A consultant tells you that it is either of type X or type Y; he cannot tell without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because they cannot operate on the same machine. Virus type X will require your computer to sit at the shop for weeks in order to fix, while Y can be removed in less than an hour. Your computer has either virus X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the computer virus is of either type X or type Y? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability the computer virus is of type X is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the computer virus is of type Y is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
