<form id="vignetteG1A">

Your friend has set you up on a blind date. When you arrive at the arranged meeting place you notice that there are two people who fit the general description that your friend has given to you. You find one of these people, person X, extremely attractive; while the other person, person Y, is of only average attractiveness. Either person X or person Y is your date but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that each person is your date? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the extremely attractive person is my date is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the that the averagely attractive person is my date is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
