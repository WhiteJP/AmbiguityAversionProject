<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

Your child has extreme talent and interest in two things: X and Y. You have heard that in a few years a local rich person is planning on funding a very generous scholarship for talented young people in either X or Y. However, at this point they have not decided whether to support X or Y. In order for your child to be eligible they will need to receive specialised training starting now, and the skills are sufficiently time-consuming that they need to pick just one. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the generous scholarship will be created for X or Y? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the scholarship will be for one thing is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the scholarship will be created for the other thing is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
