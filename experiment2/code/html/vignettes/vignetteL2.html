<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2">

You are on a hike in the remote wilderness when you are bitten by a snake; the bite happened so quickly that you could not determine the species. Only two species of snake exist in the area in which you are hiking: species X and species Y. A bite from species X is possibly lethal, while a bite from species Y is harmless. The bite is from either species X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the bite is from each species? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the bite is from one species is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability that the bite is from the other species is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
