<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2">

You are on a hike in the remote wilderness when you are bitten by a snake; the bite happened so quickly that you could not determine the species. Only two species of snake exist in the area in which you are hiking: species X and species Y. A bite from species X is possibly lethal, while a bite from species Y is harmless. The bite is from either species X or Y, but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

If you had to guess, what is the probability that the bite is from each species? <br><br>

According to my guess, the probablity that the bite is from species X is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "sliderx"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

According to my guess, the probablity that the bite is from species Y is:

      <div class = "slider" id = "slidery"> </div>
      <center><div> <input type="text" id ="inputy"/>% </div> </center>
<br>

How confident are you in your answer to the previous question?
