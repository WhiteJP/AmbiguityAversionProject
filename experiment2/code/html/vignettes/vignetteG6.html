</center>

<form id="vignetteG1A">

You are invited to two parties on the same night. You have heard that the person you are romantically interested in is definitely attending one of them, but you donâ€™t know which one. Unfortunately, the parties are three hours away from each other, so you cannot attend both. The person will be at either party X or party Y but the exact probability for each is unknown. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that your romantic interest will attend each party?<br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that my romantic interest attends one party is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability they attend the other party is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
