<h3>Question 2</h3>
</center>

<form id="vignetteL2A">

On a routine doctor visit, you learn that your body has acquired a pathogen with two possible variants: variant X and variant Y. Your doctor cannot determine which it is without further tests, but he is certain that it is not both because each one kills the other. Variant X is potentially deadly while variant Y is somewhat benign. <br><br>

<b>Question:</b> If you had to guess, what is the probability that the pathogen is of variant X or variant Y? <br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> I would guess that the probability that the pathogen is of one variant is <input type="text" id = "inputx"/>% and the probability the pathogen is of the other variant is <input type="text" id = "inputy"/>%.
