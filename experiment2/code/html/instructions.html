As mentioned, this experiment involves guessing the probability of different options. Unlike many studies which ask you to make a choice about <i>what you would do</i> in a certain situation, this experiment asks you respond with <b><i>how likely you believe a situation is</i></b>.<br><br>

Here's how it will work in a little more depth. You will be presented with two short, life-like scenarios which we call 'vignettes'. Each vignette desribes two possible underlying situations, one of which must be true. After reading each vignette, you will be asked to respond with how likely you believe each situation in the vignette is. You will answer on a sliding scale from "0%", meaning you believe the situation is impossible, to "100%", meaning you believe the situation is certain. <br><br>

Note, that both these probablities must total 100% (because, as stated above, one of the situations is definitely true). But don't worry, the sliders make automatic adjustments to ensure this happens. Lastly, you will be asked how confident you are about these answers. You will answer on a scale from "Not at all confident" to "Extremely confident" with "Somewhat confident" in the middle.<br><br>

We are interested in how people think about this kind of thing. As such there is no "right" answer and we just ask that you take it seriously and think carefully. There are only two questions so please take your time for each. <br><br>
